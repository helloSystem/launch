# launch [![Build Status](https://api.cirrus-ci.com/github/helloSystem/launch.svg)](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/helloSystem/launch)

Command line tool to launch applications, will first search `$PATH` and then `.app` bundles and `.AppDir` directories in various directories, and will show launch errors in the GUI. Filer, Dock, and other applications are supposed to use `launch` to launch applications. It can also be invoked from the command line.

## Types of error messages

In general, `launch` shows error messages that would otherwise get printed to stderr (and hence be invisible for GUI users) in a dialog box.

Some of the default error messages are less then user friendly, and do not give any clues to the user on how the situation can be resolved:

Hence, `launch` can handle certain types of error messages and provide more useful information:

It is also possible to get additional information, e.g., from the package manager:

It would even be conceivable that the dialog just asks the user for confirmation to run the suggested command automatically.
